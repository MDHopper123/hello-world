This is a new repository strictly for practicing GitHub
My name is Matthew Hopper. I tried coding at Western Kentucky University, first trying as a Computer Science Major with a Minor in Film Studies. Then, around Junior Year, I switched it around and had Film as my Major and Computer Science as my Minor. Now, not completely sure what to do, I think I could at least put my minimal amount of coding knowledge to use.
